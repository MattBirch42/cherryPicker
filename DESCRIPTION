Description: This wil eventually be a package full of cool data tools. 
    Right now it is really all about the Cherry Picker app. It provides 
    an interactive Shiny application for exploring datasets. Users can 
    upload or preload CSV/Parquet files, filter data through a 
    dynamic UI, highlight and remove points on scatterplots with Plotly, 
    and download selected subsets. Includes modular server/UI components 
    for embedding Cherry Picker inside other Shiny apps.
